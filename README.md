# paint-and-fill

This application allows users to paint and fill canvas with various colors.

Users can see a canvas on a screen with black border.

Below the canvas, users can see a bar, and with the bar, users can change a width of paint brush.

Next, users can choose a color.

Finally, there are 3 buttons at the bottom.
### 1. Mode (Paint and Fill)
First button is used for 'mode'.

There are 2 modes available, which are 'Paint' and 'Fill'. (The default mode is "Paint")

When the mode is 'Paint', users can paint the canvas by using mouse. 

Users can draw line freely by clicking and moving mouse.

When the mode is 'Fill, users can fill the canvas by clicking the canvas.
### 2. Erase
Second button is used for 'erasing' lines.

Once users click the 'erase' button, erase button is activated.

Then, users can freely erase the lines on the canvas by clicking and moving mouse.

Users should notice that they can only erase 'lines', not the 'background color' made by fill-mode.
### 3. Clear
Third button is used for 'clearing' canvas.

This button makes the canvas clean.

Nothing will be left when users click clear button.
